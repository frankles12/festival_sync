# PRD: Festival Sync UI/UX Overhaul

**Owner:** Product/Design
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Scope:** Full application UI/UX (auth, OCR, Spotify flows, modals, global styles)

## 1. Introduction / Overview

Transform the current proof-of-concept UI into a professional, production-quality application aligned with AirBnB HIG principles. The redesign will establish a cohesive design system (tokens, components, layouts), reduce cognitive load, and guide users through an intuitive, non-linear but progressive flow from lineup image upload to Spotify playlist creation.
